# ssd-segmentation
this repo it's in a work-in-progress status, i should finish everything by 12th of september 2023 :)

in this repo i'm trying to write from "scratch" (tensorflow and numpy only) a network that performs simultaneously an object detection task and a semantic segmentation task.

still work in progress! :)
